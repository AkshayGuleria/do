SQLite3 JDBC Driver
===================

This is a SQLite3 JDBC driver packaged as gem for convenient installation in JRuby.

The do_sqlite3 driver extension should automatically download and install this
gem for you, by virtue of the RubyGems requirement system.

If you want to load this driver directly:

   require 'do_jdbc/sqlite3'

to make the driver accessible to JDBC and DataObjects code running in JRuby.
