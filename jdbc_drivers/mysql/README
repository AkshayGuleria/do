MySQL JDBC Driver
=================

This is a MySQL JDBC driver packaged as gem for convenient installation in JRuby.

The do_mysql driver extension should automatically download and install this gem
for you, by virtue of the RubyGems requirement system.

If you want to load this driver directly:

   require 'do_jdbc/mysql'

to make the driver accessible to JDBC and DataObjects code running in JRuby.
