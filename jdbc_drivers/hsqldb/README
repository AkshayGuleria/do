HSQLDB JDBC Driver
==================

This is a HSQLDB JDBC driver packaged as gem for convenient installation in JRuby.

The do_hsqldb driver extension should automatically download and install this gem
for you, by virtue of the RubyGems requirement system.

If you want to load this driver directly:

   require 'do_jdbc/hsqldb'

to make the driver accessible to JDBC and DataObjects code running in JRuby.
